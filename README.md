# Mixed-Messages

##Why I Made This

I made this as part of my CodeAcademy course.

##What It Does

Everytime the button is clicked, a new random message appears. Not only is the message selected at random, but it is _created_ at random.

##How It Works

There are four templates:

1. DETERMINER ADJECTIVE NOUN MODAL-VERB VERB OBJECT-PRONOUN
2. SUBJECT-PRONOUN VERB PREPOSITION PLURAL-DETERMINER NOUN
3. DETERMINER NOUN and PLURAL-DETERMINER PLURAL-NOUN are INTENSIFIER ADJECTIVE
4. VERB DET INTENSIFIER ADJ NOUN CONJUNCTION PLURAL-DETERMINER PLURAL-NOUN

Upo n the button being clicked, one template will be chosen at random. Then what word occupies each spot in the sentence is also selected at random e.g a random adjective will be selected for ADJECTIVE.
